# GOLMLSA

GOLHackathon
Summary of Idea - Duee to the shortage of medical practitioners in Africa and owing to the concern of equity in provision of essential services like healthcare, we propose a system to help monitor each patient present in a given medical ward. A camera mounted on the wall at a position where it can see the patient's face and the screen of the BP machine attached to them is used to analyse the facials of the patient and perform a sentimental analysis and extract the vitals through text recognition. Thereafter, an analysis of the two is done and a rating of if the patient requires attention is calculated - if high, the medics are alerted on their smartphones or computers. No images are to be stored, encryption will be very key since this is medical data.
